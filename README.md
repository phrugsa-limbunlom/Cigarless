## Usage
CIGARLESS is an application that offers a practical process for helping smokers quit smoking effectively. My team and I have researched behaviours of the smokers in the community. Then, we used the collected data to finalize the features included in the application as follows:

âœ… Tracking the number of cigarettes reduced per day depending on the subscription of users' choices

ðŸŒ¿ Recommending activities to help smokers reduce their stress

ðŸ’¬ Connecting between smokers and caretakers by chatting as a consultant service

This project aims to help smokers in Thai society, who are willing to stop smoking permanently, achieve their desired goals at ease with the help of technology that is used prevalently in society nowadays.
